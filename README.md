# ML_LEAD_SCORING_CASE_STUDY
A Logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads for an edtech company, which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
